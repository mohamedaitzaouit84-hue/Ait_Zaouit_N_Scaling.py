​🚀 AZP Protocol: Ait Zaouit Dynamic Logic
​Quantum Error Mitigation via Causal Temporal Adaptation
​📌 Project Overview
​The Ait Zaouit Protocol (AZP) is an independent research project focused on breaking the limits of quantum noise in the NISQ era. By leveraging a unique logic based on Temporal Causality and Light-Time Dynamics, this protocol achieves unprecedented stability on high-depth quantum circuits.
​📊 Performance Benchmarks (Verified)
​Processor: Tested on ibm_torino (127 Qubits).
​Success Rate: Achieved a fidelity of 91.31%.
​Scaling: Maintained signal integrity at Depth 400.
​Status: Advanced Stage - Proprietary Algorithm.
